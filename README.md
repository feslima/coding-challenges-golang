The challenges presented here vary in complexity and size.

I've made these as a way to learn golang and improve some programming/computer science concepts.

List of challenges I consider complete:

- **wc** (easy): implementation of the `wc` unix utility. Reads both from file and stdin
- **redis** (intermediate): implementation of core functionalities of a redis server, such as: keyspace commands (GET, SET, etc.), KV DB persistance and Pub/Sub functionalities. The goal here is to make it compatible with client implementations and see how well my golang skills performs for these kind of tasks.
